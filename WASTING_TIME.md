## ðŸ§  Meta Framework: Stream Justification Template

Use this to prepare any future livestream with purpose:

---

### Prompt Template:

> I am livestreaming a session on:
> **`<topic>`**
> The claim is that I am wasting time.
> To falsify that claim, I will select **k questions** from a **family of CS/system design** or **business impact** domains.
> The stream is considered meaningful if these are addressed.

#### Pick from:

#### CS/System Design

* How does this scale in complexity or size?
* How is this architecture testable?
* What are the performance constraints or bottlenecks?
* What design patterns or paradigms are present?
* How is type-safety preserved across modules/components?

#### Business/UX

* What practical UX problem does this solve?
* Could this generalize into a reusable primitive?
* Is there a business case or monetization path?
* Whatâ€™s the opportunity cost of this tech choice?
* What failure scenarios could this prevent or cause?

---

### Validation Plan:

> During the stream, I will:
>
> * Display the selected `k` questions
> * Address each through code, commentary, or Q\&A
> * Conclude by stating which were satisfied and how
